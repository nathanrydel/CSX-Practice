// Create a function dateStamp that accepts a function and returns a function. The returned function will accept whatever arguments the passed-in function accepts and return an object with a date key whose value is today's date (not including the time) represented as a human-readable string (see the Date object for conversion methods), and an output key that contains the result from invoking the passed-in function.

// ADD CODE HERE

// Uncomment these to check your work!
// const stampedMultBy2 = dateStamp(n => n * 2);
// console.log(stampedMultBy2(4)); // should log: { date: (today's date), output: 8 }
// console.log(stampedMultBy2(6)); // should log: { date: (today's date), output: 12 }
